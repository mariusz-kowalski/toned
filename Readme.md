toned - sublime theme
=====================

The idea is that the code is not a Christmas Tree. For readability sake whole
theme must be bright (bright, warm background) and text must be black - 
there is a reason for books to be made that way for centuries. Another goal is
distraction free... As a human you are genetically predisposed to react on
bright colors, especially red color. So in `toned` there is no red or yellow, 
unless there is something wrong that need your special attention.

Code is classified into four groups, which corresponds with colors:
* green - control structures
* blue  - data (values, eg. string)
* black - regular code
* gray  - less important code (comments, semicolons)

There are exceptions from this classification, like regexp, which are 
brown/orange, embedded shell code - pink, and few others...

I work primarily in Ruby, so this language is best covered, other languages that
are in some way covered are HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS is hard to deal with), C
... Although I try to create generic rules, this theme requires more adjustments
and should be treated as "work in progress". Also it's tested only on Sublime
version 3.
